## ü§ñ Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch

This project focuses on building a neural network model to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on handwritten digits from the MNIST database. The primary objective is to achieve high accuracy on the test set.

### üîë Key Components:

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset will be loaded from `torchvision.datasets`, converted to tensors, normalized, and flattened using PyTorch methods. A `DataLoader` will be created for efficient data loading during training.

- **Data Visualization and Exploration**: Visualization of the dataset will be performed to understand the input format. Exploration of the data's size and shape will aid in preprocessing decisions. Any necessary preprocessing steps will be justified.

- **Neural Network Implementation**: A neural network will be built using PyTorch to predict the class of each input image. An optimizer will be defined to update the network's weights during training. The network will be trained using the training DataLoader.

- **Model Evaluation and Tuning**: The accuracy of the neural network on the test set will be evaluated. Model hyperparameters and architecture will be tuned to achieve high accuracy on the test set.
